# HW FA #1 - Optics (ODVT) Testing for AEC on QFX5240

## Test Setup
- QFX5240
- 800G OSFP (ports 0, 34)
- 400G Q112 MCB
- Credo 5m AEC Y-cable

## Goal
- Investigate near-end (TP4) and far-end (MCB) optical signal quality and margins for AEC.

## Results
- Testing done with 2 different QFX5240 - one from the lab and one RMA from customer.
- Far end signals were characterized on both 400G Q112 ends of the 5m AEC Y-cable.
- In each case, all lanes show passing results with no issues seen.
- Also, no notable difference in optical signal quality between lab and RMA chassis.
