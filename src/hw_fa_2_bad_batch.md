# HW FA #2 - Bad Batch Investigation

## Goal
- Investigate the possibility of any bad batch or bad lot issue causing failures.
- 11 failures out of 700+ systems in xAI deployment; customer reports once a failing unit is replaced, the new unit is stable and does not show the same failure mode.

## Results
- Build Date: 11 failed S/Ns are from 9 different assembly dates (Oct 2024 - June 2025).
- Mfg Site: 11 failed units from 3 different Accton production lines in 3 locations (VN, TW-ZB, TW-ZN).
- Broadcom TH5: 3 different date codes, 5 different lot codes.

## Next Steps
- Investigating DC/LC trends for timing module and components.
